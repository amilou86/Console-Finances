# Console-Finances
code for analyzing the financial records of a business.

## USER STORY
AS AN employee of a business
I WANT to be able to calculate company finances
SO THAT I can track and analyse Profit/Losses


### ACCEPTED CRITERIA

It is done when JavaScript analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

When opened in the browser, the resulting analysis looks similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

The final code should print the analysis to the console.
